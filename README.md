# Umwelt
Umwelt is a German word which means surrounding/the world as it is experienced by a particular organism. This is an idea picked up from the current research in the field of neuroscience and we were inspired by the Professor named David Eagleman and his research on sensory substitution and built a company named neosensory.

# About the Project
According to David Eagleman and the scientists' who have worked on Sensory Substitution in the field of neuroscience, Sensory substitution is a change of the characteristics of one sensory modality into stimuli of another sensory modality.

A sensory substitution system consists of three parts: a sensor, a coupling system, and a stimulator. The sensor records stimuli and gives them to a coupling system which interprets these signals and transmits them to a stimulator. In case the sensor obtains signals of a kind not originally available to the bearer it is a case of sensory augmentation. Sensory substitution concerns human perception and the plasticity of the human brain; and therefore, allows us to study these aspects of neuroscience more through neuroimaging.

Sensory substitution systems may help people by restoring their ability to perceive certain defective sensory modality by using sensory information from a functioning sensory modality.

Problem Statement
Designing a device that will help visually challenged people or people in such situations where vision can't help further, to recieve information about their surrounding that they are missing on.

Our take on the problem
We looked up the existing solutions and what we found was that most of them use hearing aids that needs to be plugged in the ears 24x7. Since after eyes, ears are the most important sense organ in terms of recieving information, using hearing aids can cause interference with the ambient sounds. To eliminate this problem we're using skin as the sense organ to recieve data. As skin is the largest sense organ, it has a vast potential to be used to gather information and this potential is rarely harnessed. In our project we're using vibration motors whose different patterns of vibrating can be morphed into a language to transmit information through skin.

Working Mechanism
We have integrated ultarsonic proximity sensors to a jacket which will detect any obsatcle in the front, back, left or right of the wearer. Also, we've a pair of shoes with infrared proximity sensors attached to them in the sole ant in the front to detect obstacles in two planes i.e. the ground level and in front of the feet. This is especially useful in the case of the wearer using stairs.
To transmit all this information we've designed a belt and anklets with a series of vibration motors on them. The pattern of vibration is dependent on the position of the obstacles. This pattern is actually analogous to language which will be recieved by the skin and will be deciphered by the subconscious mind without requiring the user to divert their attention.

Field of Application
 Visually challenged people: To aid their day to day life without compromising on the ambient sounds. Has a vast capacity to minimize accidents.
 Drone pilots: Since most of the information is displayed on a screen they have to divide their attention to access different information. With this device more amount of information can be accessed simutaneously without dividing the attention span.
 Deep sea divers/ miners: Most of the time their working environment lacks availability of light. This device will help them being aware of the obstacles and potential sources of accidents.

Device used
 Microcontroller (Arduino Uno)
 Ultrasonic proximity sensors
 Infrared proximity sensors
 Vibration motors

Modifications
We're going to integrate IR camera with our project to detect fire or any hot object to prevent accidents. Also, accelerometers will be integrated. We can use AI to detect movements and identify objects. And many more modifications to make the device even better.
